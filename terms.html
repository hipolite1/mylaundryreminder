  <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
  <p><strong>Quenex Canada Inc.</strong> (“Company,” “we,” “us”) operates MyLaundryReminder (<a href="https://mylaundryreminder.com">mylaundryreminder.com</a>).

  <h2>2) The Service</h2>
  <p>MyLaundryReminder enables dry cleaners to collect customer contact details and a pickup due date, then send automated SMS reminders on the due date and, if configured, daily thereafter until pickup. The Service is not a POS/CRM replacement.</p>

  <h2>3) Accounts & eligibility</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must be at least 18 and authorized to act for your business.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for safeguarding login credentials and all activity under your account.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Subscriptions, trials, payments, taxes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Plans & billing:</strong> You select a plan (e.g., Single Store, Growth, Pro). Fees are billed in advance on a recurring basis (monthly or annually) via Stripe. You authorize us to charge your payment method until you cancel.</li>
    <li><strong>Free trial:</strong> If offered (e.g., 30 days), billing begins automatically after the trial unless you cancel before the trial ends.</li>
    <li><strong>Price changes:</strong> We may modify fees with reasonable notice; changes apply to the next billing cycle.</li>
    <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> Fees exclude taxes. Where applicable, you are responsible for VAT/GST/HST/sales tax.</li>
    <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Except where required by law, fees are non-refundable. You may cancel any time to stop future charges.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Cancellations</h2>
  <p>You can cancel anytime from your Stripe customer portal (link in your email receipt) or by contacting support. Your access continues through the paid period; then your account may be downgraded or deactivated.</p>

  <h2>6) Messaging compliance (SMS)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> You must obtain valid consent from your customers before sending SMS through the Service and maintain proof of that consent.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> Every message must include opt-out instructions. Customers can reply <code>STOP</code> to end messages and <code>HELP</code> for help.</li>
    <li><strong>Content:</strong> No prohibited content (e.g., illegal, abusive, SHAFT categories, or spam). You are solely responsible for message content and frequency settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Messages should identify your business (e.g., include your store name) and a support contact.</li>
    <li><strong>Deliverability:</strong> Carriers/providers may filter messages. We do not guarantee delivery or timing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10) Service changes & availability</h2>
  <p>We may modify or discontinue features with reasonable notice when practical. We aim for high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.</p>

  <h2>11) Disclaimers</h2>

OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO US IN THE 6 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.</p>

  <h2>13) Indemnity</h2>
  <p>You will defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from claims arising from your use of the Service, including your SMS content, consent practices, and breach of these Terms.</p>

  <h2>14) Governing law; disputes</h2>

You and we irrevocably attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Toronto, Ontario, for all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service.</p>
